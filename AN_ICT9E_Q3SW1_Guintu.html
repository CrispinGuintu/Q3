					<h1> How did the story start?</h1>
					<p class="story"> It first started when out of nowhere, women from around the world suddenly became pregnant with children. There were around 40 children who were born that day. A billionaire wanted to buy these children because he thought there would be something special about them. He got 7 of them. </p>

					<h3><center> What makes the story good? </center></h3>

				</div>
					<br><br>
					
					<center><p style="font-size: 125%;"> I think the suspense and the mystery part of the show makes it interesting to watch. The CGI and the visual effects in this show are also really good, it makes it more realistic. Each child that was born had their own special power.</center></p>
